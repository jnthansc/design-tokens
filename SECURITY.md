# Security Guidelines for Design Tokens

## Overview

This repository serves as the source of truth for design tokens and requires high security standards due to its critical role in the design system infrastructure.

## Security Measures

### 1. Repository Protection

- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires:
  - Pull request reviews (minimum 2 reviewers)
  - Status checks must pass (tests, validation, linting)
  - Up-to-date branches before merging
  - No force pushes or deletions

### 2. Access Control

- **Team Access**: 
  - Design team: Read access + ability to create PRs
  - Design system maintainers: Write access
  - Admins: Full access
- **Token Sync**: Use dedicated service account with minimal permissions
- **Registry Access**: Private npm registry with scoped access

### 3. Automated Security Checks

```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      # Audit dependencies
      - name: Audit dependencies
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      
      # Check for secrets
      - name: Scan for secrets
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
        with:
          path: ./
          base: main
          head: HEAD
```

### 4. Token Validation

- **Schema Validation**: Ensure tokens follow DTCG format
- **Reference Validation**: Check for circular references
- **Value Validation**: Validate color formats, dimensions, etc.
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Compare with previous version

### 5. Secrets Management

- **NPM_TOKEN**: Store in GitHub Secrets for registry publishing
- **FIGMA_TOKEN**: For Tokens Studio sync (if automated)
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: For automated releases and tagging

### 6. Audit Trail

- **All Changes Tracked**: Git history provides complete audit trail
- **Release Notes**: Automated generation with change summaries
- **Version Tagging**: Semantic versioning for all releases

### 7. Rollback Strategy

- **Version Pinning**: Applications should pin to specific versions
- **Rollback Process**: 
  1. Identify problematic version
  2. Revert changes in git
  3. Create hotfix release
  4. Notify consuming applications

### 8. Monitoring

- **Build Failures**: Alert on failed builds or validations
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor which applications use which versions
- **Performance Impact**: Track bundle size changes

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated alerts or manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity
3. **Containment**: Stop automated deployments if needed
4. **Resolution**: Fix issue and deploy corrected version
5. **Communication**: Notify affected teams
6. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
- **Minimal Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Code Reviews**: All changes require peer review
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for validation scripts
- **Documentation**: Keep security procedures documented and current
